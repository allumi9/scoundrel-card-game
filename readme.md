# Scoundrel
Concept by Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg. I tried playing with real cards, and it's a pain to track health with no like d20 cube, so I had to do something. It's probably horrible code in terms of good C, but this my first more than 50 lines of code C program.

## Executing
There is now an actual Makefile wow-wow.\
gcc version is 11.4.0\
\
**Compile**: `make`\
**Test**: `make test` (Make sure to have [criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion) installed)\
**Clean up**: `make clean` (this is for cleaning up .o objects)\
